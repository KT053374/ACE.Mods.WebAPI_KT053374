*Thanks to Jkurs for the original `/raise`*

This mod adds common "infinite" features like a custom max level and `/raise` command:

* `/raise` can be used on any attribute and a few `PropertyInt` values that correspond to Luminance ratings.  Adding more is easy.
* ``/raiserefund` (`/rr`) refunds the player and invested resource
* `/raiselist` (`/rl`) sends the player a list of their raised levels and resources spent

The number of times a target has been raised is stored using an offset to its enum value as a `PropertyInt`.
